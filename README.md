# Online Inspection of Packed Cases (Ripe/Unripe)

This project aims to develop a system for online inspection of packed cases to determine the ripeness or unripeness of products using image processing and machine learning techniques. It is designed to ensure quality control in packaging and streamline the inspection process.

## Features

- **Automated Inspection**: Detect and classify ripe and unripe items in packed cases.
- **Real-time Processing**: Perform inspection in real-time for seamless integration into production lines.
- **Image Processing**: Utilize advanced image processing techniques to analyze visual features.
- **Machine Learning**: Train and deploy machine learning models for accurate classification.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and controlling the inspection system.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (for machine learning models)
  - NumPy, Pandas (for data handling and analysis)
- **Hardware**: Camera module for capturing images of packed cases
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python libraries installed:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy pandas
  ```
- Camera or image dataset for testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harinath206/online-inspection-packed-cases.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd online-inspection-packed-cases
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Capture images of packed cases using the camera module or load images from the dataset.
2. Run the inspection script:
   ```bash
   python inspect_cases.py
   ```
3. View the results in the output console or GUI.

## File Structure

- **`dataset/`**: Contains sample images for training and testing
- **`models/`**: Pre-trained machine learning models
- **`scripts/`**:
  - `inspect_cases.py`: Main script for performing inspection
  - `train_model.py`: Script for training the machine learning model
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries

## How It Works

1. **Image Capture**: The system captures images of packed cases using a camera module.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed to enhance quality and extract features.
3. **Classification**: The preprocessed images are fed into a machine learning model for classification.
4. **Output**: The system outputs the ripeness status (ripe/unripe) for each item in the case.

## Customization

- Modify the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your custom dataset.
- Update parameters in `config.json` to adjust preprocessing or model settings.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with IoT for remote monitoring.
- Advanced classification using deep learning architectures.
- Expand to multi-class classification for different ripeness levels.
